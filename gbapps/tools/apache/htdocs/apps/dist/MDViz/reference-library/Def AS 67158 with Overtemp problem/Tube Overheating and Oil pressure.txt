Unit had resets due to Tube temeprature
MDViz tool shows increase in Oil pressure and at the same time increase in Oil temperature
No service was done on the unit during the time increase in Oil pressure seen
Problem maybe obstruction to oil flow, resulting in higher Oil pressure and lower efficiency in cooling.
Replaced tube cooler, did not help. Tube replaced.
