The unit had tube temperature error in the morning during checkup, Unit resets a few times during checkup and unit rescans again. After a few tries of reset and recans the unit then completes the checkup and scans fine the whole day. The problem repeated for 3 days and then tube was replaced to solve the problem. 
We see the Cathode 2 temperature was very high during switch on in the morning and after a few tries stabilized and then was able to keep the temperature steady.
Comparing with the A sdie tube on the same unit as it has the same cooler for both tubes, clearly shows problem with tube
Here are the errors and warnings from the unit
