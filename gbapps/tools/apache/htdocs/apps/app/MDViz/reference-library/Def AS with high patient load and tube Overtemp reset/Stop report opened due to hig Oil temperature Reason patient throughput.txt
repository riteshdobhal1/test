This unit was detected by Guardian as having resets due to tube OIl temperature.
CT_DCA_16 error Stop report loop opened.
CSE informed this is a very high throughput site and that maybe the reason.
Checked previous tube and found that the previous tube also had overheating problem.
Conclusion no problem onsite and the customer workflow is overheating the tube.
