Customer noticed Oil leak from the Gantry
CSE checked and found Oil traces in the covers and at the bottom of the Gantry but not in rotating part. Was not sure where the Oil leak was from
Checking the tube history we see an Oil presssure drop. The Oil leak is from the tube or cooler, Since it is a very small leak the Oil traces are not seen in the rotating part of the Gantry as it dries off.
